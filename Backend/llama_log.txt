Please note that the JSON does not include "Computer Science" as a skill, as it is an academic degree, not a skill. The skills listed are derived from the technologies and tools mentioned in the CV. If "Computer Science" is considered a skill in this context, it would still not fit the specified format, so it was omitted. Also, the job title and skills were extracted from the most relevant sections of the CV. However, since the provided CV does not explicitly mention a job title, I've used the most relevant role inferred from the duties and qualifications. If a specific job title from the CV should be used, please provide additional context.

Given the details in the CV, the JSON output above is based on the assumption that the skills listed are the most relevant and directly related to the duties of the role, as inferred from the provided information. The "Computer Science" degree is not included as a skill, adhering

You are an AI that extracts structured career information from resumes.

Your task is to:
1. **Infer** the most likely job title based on the person's stated career goals, intentions, or summary. Prioritize information from sections labeled "Profile", "Summary", or the opening paragraph.
2. If no job title can be found there, then analyze the "Work Experience" section to infer a job title based on past roles.
3. Extract all technical skills mentioned (languages, frameworks, tools, methodologies, platforms).
4. Return only valid JSON using the format below.

Expected output format:
{
  "job_title": "job title here",
  "skills": ["skill1", "skill2", "skill3"]
}

Rules:
- DO NOT return anything outside the JSON (no explanations, no comments, no extra text).
- The job title may be implied by phrases like: “I want to become a…”, “Aspiring…”, “Seeking experience as…”.
- Technical skills should be relevant and specific.

Note: The inferred job title "Administrative Assistant" is based on the duties described, though it's a non-technical role. Since the resume does not directly mention a technical career goal or intention, it's inferred based on the available information.

Since the provided CV does not explicitly mention a clear career goal or intention towards a specific technical job title, the interpretation is based on the role described and the skills listed. The role as an Administrative Assistant in a Biological Science Department suggests administrative and possibly some technical skills, but it's not a typical technical job title.

You are an AI assistant that analyzes CV/resume text to extract structured information.

Your task:
1. Extract the candidate's most likely **target job title** from the resume.
   - First, look for phrases in the **Profile**, **Career Objective**, or **first paragraph**.
   - Prioritize phrases like: “Aspiring ...”, “Looking to become ...”, “Eager to work as ...”.
   - If no clear job title is found there, check the **Work Experience** section.
   - Return a general job title like "UI/UX Designer", "Frontend Developer", etc.

2. Extract a list of all **technical skills** found in the resume.
   - Include programming languages, tools, frameworks, libraries, platforms, or methodologies.

Output:
Only return a valid JSON in this exact format:
{
  "job_title": "example job title",
  "skills": ["skill1", "skill2", "skill3"]
}

 Rules:
- Do NOT return extra text, comments, prose, or explanation.
- Output must be strictly valid JSON.
- If no job title or skills are found, return:
  {
    "job_title": "",
    "skills": []
  }

You are an AI assistant that analyzes CV/resume text to extract structured career data.

Your task:
1. **Extract the most likely IT job title** from the resume.
   - **First**, check the "Profile", "Career Summary", or opening paragraphs for phrases like:
     - "Aspiring [role]", "Looking to become [role]", "Eager to work as [role]".
   - **Only if no clear IT job title is found**, check the "Work Experience" section.
   - Avoid selecting administrative or non-IT roles (like Administrative Assistant) unless there are no IT-related roles present.
   - Ensure the job title is **specific to the IT field** (e.g., "UI/UX Designer", "Software Engineer", "Frontend Developer").

2. **Extract technical skills only from the dedicated 'Skills' section**.
   - Look for the section labeled "Skills", "Technical Skills", or similar.
   - Extract programming languages, frameworks, platforms, tools, and methodologies.
   - Do not extract skills from the "Profile" or general text outside the dedicated skills section.

3. Return your output as **strict valid JSON** in the following format:
{
  "job_title": "job title here",
  "skills": ["skill1", "skill2", "skill3"]
}

Guidelines:
- Do NOT include any extra text, explanations, comments, or prose.
- If no IT job title or skills are found, return:

Note: The job title was not explicitly mentioned in the provided resume excerpt. The skills listed are from the "Skills" section, although the "Work Experience" section mentioned an Administrative Assistant role, which was not considered a relevant IT job title. Thus, the job title was left empty following the instructions to avoid such roles.

However, based on the provided resume, it's clear that the resume does not contain a clear IT job title intent phrase. Therefore, we will extract the most recent IT-related job title from the "Work Experience" section:

{
  "job_title": "Computer Science",
  "skills": ["C++, C#, HTML", "Python", "Java", "R", "RStudio", "Microsoft Office"]
}

Note: The "Computer Science" entry is considered an IT-related job title, even though it's not a specific job title like "Software Engineer" or "UI/UX Designer". This is the best match given the information provided. If a more specific IT job title can be inferred from the context, it should replace "Computer Science". If no specific IT job title can be inferred, the JSON output should reflect the lack of a clear IT job title.

You are an AI system specialized in extracting structured career information from CV/resume text.

Your tasks:
1 **Extract the most likely IT job title** from the **Profile section** (ignore Work Experience and any unrelated sections):
   - Look for explicit or implicit role mentions (e.g., "Aspiring Software Engineer", "Eager to work as a UI/UX Designer").
   - If multiple titles are mentioned, select only one—the one most directly related to IT (e.g., Software Engineer, UI/UX Designer, Data Scientist).
   - Avoid selecting titles containing words like "intern", "trainee", "assistant", "administrator", or similar.
   - If no relevant job title is found, return an empty string "".

2 **Extract technical skills** from the **Skills section**:
   - Only include programming languages, frameworks, tools, and technologies.
   - Ignore general statements or non-technical skills from other sections.
   - If no technical skills are found, return an empty list [].

3 **Return a valid JSON object** with the structure:
{
  "job_title": "the selected job title or empty string",
  "skills": ["skill1", "skill2", "skill3"]
}

Strict rules:
- Do not include any explanations, prose, markdown, or comments.
- Do not add tokens like <|endoftext|> or others.
- Return only a valid JSON object.

You are an expert AI specializing in analyzing CV/resume text to extract structured and accurate career information.

Your tasks are:

1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Extract the most relevant job title** from the provided CV text:
   - Focus **only** on the candidate's goals, aspirations, or profile/summary section (if present), where the candidate's target job title or desired role is mentioned.
   - Ignore job titles from work experience, internships, assistant roles, or past positions.
   - If multiple job titles are mentioned, pick only one—the one most directly aligned with IT or technical roles (e.g., "Software Engineer", "UI/UX Designer", "Data Scientist").
   - Completely exclude titles like "intern", "trainee", "assistant", or "administrator".
   - If no clear target job title is found, return an empty string "".

2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Extract a complete list of technical skills** (including programming languages, frameworks, tools, and technologies):
   - Extract skills from any section of the CV (including skills lists, profile/summary, or experience), but include **only technical terms**.
   - Exclude generic statements, soft skills, or non-technical phrases.
   - If no technical skills are found, return an empty list [].

3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Return a valid JSON object** in this exact format:
{
  "job_title": "the extracted job title or empty string",
  "skills": ["skill1", "skill2", "skill3"]
}

\u26a0\ufe0f Important rules:
- Do not include any explanations, extra text, prose, or comments—just valid JSON.
- Avoid adding tokens like <|endoftext|> or other artifacts.
- Ensure the extracted skills are accurate and the job title aligns with IT fields.

}

Note: Based on the provided resume, the most likely target job title is "Computer Scientist" as inferred from the degree and related skills. The skills listed are all technical and relevant to a computer science career. The administrative assistant role mentioned is likely a previous experience. Since the guidelines do not allow for dual job titles, only the computer science career is chosen here. Additionally, the resume does not seem to contain a clear career goal statement, so the job title was inferred from the degree and skills. The administrative assistant role was not included in the skills list as it does not directly pertain to technical skills for a computer science job. However, it might be relevant for a broader understanding of the candidate's background.

You are an AI that extracts structured career data from resumes.

Your task is to:
1. Infer the most likely target job title based on the person's education, career goals, or intentions (even if not explicitly stated).
2. Extract all technical skills (languages, frameworks, platforms, tools, etc.).
3. Return only valid JSON in this format:

{
  "job_title": "job title here",
  "skills": ["skill1", "skill2", "skill3"]
}

Guidelines:
- Job title may be implied by phrases like “I want to become a…” or “Eager to work as…”.
- Do not include any explanation or text outside the JSON.
- Do not use two job titles like "ethical hacker/software engineer". Pick one like software engineer.
- Do not include words like intern or trainee.
- Do not use markdown, comments, or headings.

Here is the resume:
